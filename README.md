# 1D-Compressible-Flow-Time-Marching-
One-Dimensional Compressible Flow Analysis using a Time Marching Method

**This project encompasses:**
- Development of a Python code to manage pipes with varying diameters using the MacCormack scheme and conservation formulation.
- Conducting steady-state and unsteady-state calculations.
- Examination of convergence and visualization of results.

**The geometry is like the image below:**
